          <!-- <h2>The History of Daniel Maldonado</h2> -->
          <p>
            Born in 1983, I grew up in Texas where music, art, and football shaped much of my early world. I began designing as a teenager, creating punk and hardcore flyers, demo covers, and t-shirts for my band Thumbscrew, which I played in while I was still in high school. Most nights were spent at Kinko’s, cutting, taping, and photocopying artwork to post around town ahead of weekend shows.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Thumbscrew gained momentum and started touring, I took on double duty as a musician and the band’s dedicated visual designer. To keep things self-sufficient, I co-founded a small DIY print shop with a bandmate and we produced our own merchandise in-house. Over the next few years, we spent most of the year on the road, playing shows, designing for other bands, and building relationships across the independent music scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            After our touring days wrapped, I continued running the print shop before joining a signage company as a pre-press designer and art specialist. A few years later, I returned to school and earned a degree in Web Design & Interactive Media while working full-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I work as a product designer focused on user experience for digital platforms. Broken Vow is my personal practice where I return to physicality, expression, and a more instinctive way of creating. I continue to design limited-run merchandise, album art, posters, and abstract visuals for bands, tattoo shops, and boutique brands. My process blends digital and analog, always rooted in nostalgia and the visual language of underground music culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently play in DSGNS, stay active in the hardcore and punk scenes, and remain deeply involved in the community through both my music and design work. Outside of that, I’m a proud dad who spends weekends supporting my two sons in football, baseball, and training, while also staying dedicated to my own growth and discipline.
